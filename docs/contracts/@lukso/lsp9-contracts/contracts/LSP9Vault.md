# LSP9Vault

:::info Standard Specifications

[`LSP-9-Vault`](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-9-Vault.md)

:::
:::info Solidity implementation

[`LSP9Vault.sol`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/tree/develop/packages/lsp9-contracts/contracts/LSP9Vault.sol)

:::

> Implementation of LSP9Vault built on top of [ERC725], [LSP-1-UniversalReceiver]

Could be owned by an EOA or by a contract and is able to receive and send assets. Also allows for registering received assets by leveraging the key-value storage.

## Public Methods

Public methods are accessible externally from users, allowing interaction with this function from dApps or other smart contracts.
When marked as 'public', a method can be called both externally and internally, on the other hand, when marked as 'external', a method can only be called externally.

### constructor

:::note References

- Specification details: [**LSP-9-Vault**](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-9-Vault.md#constructor)
- Solidity implementation: [`LSP9Vault.sol`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/tree/develop/packages/lsp9-contracts/contracts/LSP9Vault.sol)

:::

```solidity
constructor(address newOwner);
```

_Deploying a LSP9Vault contract with owner set to address `initialOwner`._

Sets `initialOwner` as the contract owner and the `SupportedStandards:LSP9Vault` Data Key. The `constructor` also allows funding the contract on deployment.

<blockquote>

**Emitted events:**

- [`UniversalReceiver`](#universalreceiver) event when funding the contract on deployment.
- [`OwnershipTransferred`](#ownershiptransferred) event when `initialOwner` is set as the contract [`owner`](#owner).
- [`DataChanged`](#datachanged) event when setting the [`_LSP9_SUPPORTED_STANDARDS_KEY`](#_lsp9_supported_standards_key).
- [`UniversalReceiver`](#universalreceiver) event when notifying the `initialOwner`.

</blockquote>

#### Parameters

| Name       |   Type    | Description                    |
| ---------- | :-------: | ------------------------------ |
| `newOwner` | `address` | The new owner of the contract. |

### fallback

:::note References

- Specification details: [**LSP-9-Vault**](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-9-Vault.md#fallback)
- Solidity implementation: [`LSP9Vault.sol`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/tree/develop/packages/lsp9-contracts/contracts/LSP9Vault.sol)

:::

```solidity
fallback(bytes calldata callData) external payable returns (bytes memory);
```

_The `fallback` function was called with the following amount of native tokens: `msg.value`; and the following calldata: `callData`._

Achieves the goal of [LSP-17-ContractExtension] standard by extending the contract to handle calls of functions that do not exist natively,
forwarding the function call to the extension address mapped to the function being called.
This function is executed when:

- Sending data of length less than 4 bytes to the contract.

- The first 4 bytes of the calldata do not match any publicly callable functions from the contract ABI.

- Receiving native tokens with some calldata.

1. If the data is equal or longer than 4 bytes, the [ERC-725Y] storage is queried with the following data key: [_LSP17_EXTENSION_PREFIX] + `bytes4(msg.sig)` (Check [LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema] for encoding the data key)

- If there is no address stored under the following data key, revert with [`NoExtensionFoundForFunctionSelector(bytes4)`](#noextensionfoundforfunctionselector). The data key relative to `bytes4(0)` is an exception, where no reverts occurs if there is no extension address stored under. This exception is made to allow users to send random data (graffiti) to the account and to be able to react on it.

- If there is an address, forward the `msg.data` to the extension using the CALL opcode, appending 52 bytes (20 bytes of `msg.sender` and 32 bytes of `msg.value`). Return what the calls returns, or revert if the call failed.

2. If the data sent to this function is of length less than 4 bytes (not a function selector), return.

<blockquote>

**Emitted events:**

- [`UniversalReceiver`](#universalreceiver) event when receiving native tokens and extension function selector is not found or not payable.

- Function signature: `transferOwnership(address)`
- Function selector: `0xf2fde38b`

:::

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external nonpayable;
```

_Transfer ownership initiated by `newOwner`._

Initiate the process of transferring ownership of the contract by setting the new owner as the pending owner. If the new owner is a contract that supports + implements LSP1, this will also attempt to notify the new owner that ownership has been transferred to them by calling the [`universalReceiver()`](#universalreceiver) function on the `newOwner` contract.

<blockquote>

**Requirements:**

- Can be only called by the [`owner`](#owner) or by an authorised address that pass the verification check performed on the owner.
- When notifying the new owner via LSP1, the `typeId` used must be the `keccak256(...)` hash of [LSP0OwnershipTransferStarted].
- Pending owner cannot accept ownership in the same tx via the LSP1 hook.

</blockquote>

#### Parameters

| Name       |   Type    | Description                   |
| ---------- | :-------: | ----------------------------- |
| `newOwner` | `address` | The address of the new owner. |

- Solidity implementation: [`LSP9Vault.sol`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/tree/develop/packages/lsp9-contracts/contracts/LSP9Vault.sol)
- Function signature: `universalReceiver(bytes32,bytes)`
- Function selector: `0x6bb56a14`

:::

```solidity
function universalReceiver(
  bytes32 typeId,
  bytes receivedData
) external payable returns (bytes returnedValues);
```

_Notifying the contract by calling its `universalReceiver` function with the following informations: typeId: `typeId`; data: `data`._

Achieves the goal of [LSP-1-UniversalReceiver] by allowing the account to be notified about incoming/outgoing transactions and enabling reactions to these actions. The reaction is achieved by having two external contracts ([LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate]) that react on the whole transaction and on the specific typeId, respectively. The function performs the following steps:

1. Query the [ERC-725Y] storage with the data key [_LSP1_UNIVERSAL_RECEIVER_DELEGATE_KEY].

- If there is an address stored under the data key, check if this address supports the LSP1 interfaceId.

- If yes, call this address with the typeId and data (params), along with additional calldata consisting of 20 bytes of `msg.sender` and 32 bytes of `msg.value`. If not, continue the execution of the function.

2. Query the [ERC-725Y] storage with the data key [_LSP1_UNIVERSAL_RECEIVER_DELEGATE_PREFIX] + `bytes32(typeId)`. (Check [LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema] for encoding the data key)

- If there is an address stored under the data key, check if this address supports the LSP1 interfaceId.

- If yes, call this address with the typeId and data (params), along with additional calldata consisting of 20 bytes of `msg.sender` and 32 bytes of `msg.value`. If not, continue the execution of the function.

<blockquote>

**Emitted events:**

- [`UniversalReceiver`](#universalreceiver) event with the function parameters, call options, and the response of the UniversalReceiverDelegates (URD) contract that was called.

## Internal Methods

Any method labeled as `internal` serves as utility function within the contract. They can be used when writing solidity contracts that inherit from this contract. These methods can be extended or modified by overriding their internal behavior to suit specific needs.

Internal functions cannot be called externally, whether from other smart contracts, dApp interfaces, or backend services. Their restricted accessibility ensures that they remain exclusively available within the context of the current contract, promoting controlled and encapsulated usage of these internal utilities.

### \_checkOwner

```solidity
function _checkOwner() internal view;
```

Throws if the sender is not the owner.

<br/>

### \_setOwner

```solidity
function _setOwner(address newOwner) internal nonpayable;
```

Changes the owner if `newOwner` and oldOwner are different
This pattern is useful in inheritance.

<br/>

) internal view returns (bool);
```

Returns whether the interfaceId being checked is supported in the extension of the
[`supportsInterface`](#supportsinterface) selector.
To be used by extendable contracts wishing to extend the ERC165 interfaceIds originally
supported by reading whether the interfaceId queried is supported in the `supportsInterface`
extension if the extension is set, if not it returns false.

<br/>

### \_getExtensionAndForwardValue

```solidity
function _getExtensionAndForwardValue(

```

Returns the extension address stored under the following data key:

- [`_LSP17_EXTENSION_PREFIX`](#_lsp17_extension_prefix) + `<bytes4>` (Check [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] for encoding the data key).

- If no extension is stored, returns the address(0).

<br/>

### \_fallbackLSP17Extendable

:::tip Hint

This function does not forward to the extension contract the `msg.value` received by the contract that inherits `LSP17Extendable`.
If you would like to forward the `msg.value` to the extension contract, you can override the code of this internal function as follow:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory result) = extension.call{value: msg.value}(
    abi.encodePacked(callData, msg.sender, msg.value)
);
```

:::

```solidity
function _fallbackLSP17Extendable(
  bytes callData
) internal nonpayable returns (bytes);
```

Forwards the call to an extension mapped to a function selector.
Calls [`_getExtensionAndForwardValue`](#_getextensionandforwardvalue) to get the address of the extension mapped to the function selector being
called on the account. If there is no extension, the `address(0)` will be returned.
Forwards the value if the extension is payable.
Reverts if there is no extension for the function being called, except for the `bytes4(0)` function selector, which passes even if there is no extension for it.
If there is an extension for the function selector being called, it calls the extension with the
`CALL` opcode, passing the `msg.data` appended with the 20 bytes of the [`msg.sender`](#msg.sender) and 32 bytes of the `msg.value`.

<br/>

### \_validateAndIdentifyCaller

```solidity
function _validateAndIdentifyCaller() internal view returns (bool isURD);
```

Internal method restricting the call to the owner of the contract and the UniversalReceiverDelegate
