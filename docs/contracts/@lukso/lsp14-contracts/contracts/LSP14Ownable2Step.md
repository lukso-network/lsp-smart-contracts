> LSP14Ownable2Step

This contract is a modified version of the [`OwnableUnset.sol`] implementation, where transferring and renouncing ownership works as a 2-step process. This can be used as a confirmation mechanism to prevent potential mistakes when transferring ownership of the contract, where the control of the contract could be lost forever. (_e.g: providing the wrong address as a parameter to the function, transferring ownership to an EOA for which the user lost its private key, etc..._)

## Public Methods

Public methods are accessible externally from users, allowing interaction with this function from dApps or other smart contracts.
When marked as 'public', a method can be called both externally and internally, on the other hand, when marked as 'external', a method can only be called externally.

```solidity
function acceptOwnership() external nonpayable;

- The current [`owner()`](#owner) will lose access to the functions restricted to the [`owner()`](#owner) only.

- The [`pendingOwner()`](#pendingowner) will gain access to the functions restricted to the [`owner()`](#owner) only.

<blockquote>

**Requirements:**

- This function can only be called by the [`pendingOwner()`](#pendingowner).

:::

:::info

If no ownership transfer is in progress, the pendingOwner will be `address(0).`.

:::

```solidity
function pendingOwner() external view returns (address);
```

The address that ownership of the contract is transferred to. This address may use [`acceptOwnership()`](#acceptownership) to gain ownership of the contract.

#### Returns

| Name |   Type    | Description |
| ---- | :-------: | ----------- |
| `0`  | `address` | -           |

- Function signature: `renounceOwnership()`
- Function selector: `0x715018a6`

:::

:::danger

Leaves the contract without an owner. Once ownership of the contract has been renounced, any function that is restricted to be called only by the owner will be permanently inaccessible, making these functions not callable anymore and unusable.

:::

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() external nonpayable;
```

_`msg.sender` is renouncing ownership of contract `address(this)`._

Renounce ownership of the contract in a 2-step process.

1. The first call will initiate the process of renouncing ownership.

2. The second call is used as a confirmation and will leave the contract without an owner.

<br/>

### transferOwnership

- Function signature: `transferOwnership(address)`
- Function selector: `0xf2fde38b`

:::

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external nonpayable;
```

_Transfer ownership initiated by `newOwner`._

Initiate the process of transferring ownership of the contract by setting the new owner as the pending owner. If the new owner is a contract that supports + implements LSP1, this will also attempt to notify the new owner that ownership has been transferred to them by calling the [`universalReceiver()`](#universalreceiver) function on the `newOwner` contract.

<blockquote>

**Requirements:**

- `newOwner` cannot accept ownership of the contract in the same transaction. (For instance, via a callback from its [`universalReceiver(...)`](#universalreceiver) function).

</blockquote>

#### Parameters

| Name       |   Type    | Description                   |
| ---------- | :-------: | ----------------------------- |
| `newOwner` | `address` | The address of the new owner. |

<br/>

## Internal Methods

Any method labeled as `internal` serves as utility function within the contract. They can be used when writing solidity contracts that inherit from this contract. These methods can be extended or modified by overriding their internal behavior to suit specific needs.

Internal functions cannot be called externally, whether from other smart contracts, dApp interfaces, or backend services. Their restricted accessibility ensures that they remain exclusively available within the context of the current contract, promoting controlled and encapsulated usage of these internal utilities.

### \_checkOwner

```solidity
function _checkOwner() internal view;
```

Throws if the sender is not the owner.

<br/>

### \_setOwner

```solidity
function _setOwner(address newOwner) internal nonpayable;
```

Changes the owner if `newOwner` and oldOwner are different
This pattern is useful in inheritance.

<br/>

### \_transferOwnership

```solidity
function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal nonpayable;
```

Set the pending owner of the contract and cancel any renounce ownership process that was previously started.

<blockquote>

**Requirements:**

- `newOwner` cannot be the address of the contract itself.

</blockquote>

#### Parameters

| Name       |   Type    | Description                           |
| ---------- | :-------: | ------------------------------------- |
| `newOwner` | `address` | The address of the new pending owner. |

<br/>

### \_acceptOwnership

```solidity
function _acceptOwnership() internal nonpayable;
```

Set the pending owner of the contract as the new owner.

<br/>

### \_renounceOwnership

```solidity
function _renounceOwnership() internal nonpayable;
```

Initiate or confirm the process of renouncing ownership after a specific delay of blocks have passed.

<br/>
