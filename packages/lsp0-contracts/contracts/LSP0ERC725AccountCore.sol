     * @dev Achieves the goal of [LSP-17-ContractExtension] standard by extending the contract to handle calls of functions that do not exist natively,
     * forwarding the function call to the extension address mapped to the function being called.
     *
     * This function is executed when:
     *    - Sending data of length less than 4 bytes to the contract.
     *    - The first 4 bytes of the calldata do not match any publicly callable functions from the contract ABI.
     *    - Receiving native tokens with some calldata.
     *
     * 1. If the data is equal or longer than 4 bytes, the [ERC-725Y] storage is queried with the following data key: [_LSP17_EXTENSION_PREFIX] + `bytes4(msg.sig)` (Check [LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema] for encoding the data key)
     *
     *   - If there is no address stored under the following data key, revert with {NoExtensionFoundForFunctionSelector(bytes4)}. The data key relative to `bytes4(0)` is an exception, where no reverts occurs if there is no extension address stored under. This exception is made to allow users to send random data (graffiti) to the account and to be able to react on it.
     *
     *   - If there is an address, forward the `msg.data` to the extension using the CALL opcode, appending 52 bytes (20 bytes of `msg.sender` and 32 bytes of `msg.value`). Return what the calls returns, or revert if the call failed.
     *
     * 2. If the data sent to this function is of length less than 4 bytes (not a function selector), return.
     *
     * @custom:info Whenever the call is associated with native tokens, the function will delegate the handling of native tokens internally to the {universalReceiver} function
     * passing `_TYPEID_LSP0_VALUE_RECEIVED` as typeId and the calldata as received data, except when the native token will be sent directly to the extension.
     *
